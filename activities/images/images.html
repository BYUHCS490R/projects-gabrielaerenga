        <h4>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h4>
        <p>JPEG is best for photographs and images with complex details, smooth gradients, and no need for transparency, such as landscapes, portraits, and sunsets.</p>
        <h4>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h4>
        <p>You should encode photos or graphics with limited colors, sharp lines, and large areas of solid color using the GIF format.</p>
        <h4>What is unique about the PNG format?</h4>
        <p>Unlike JPEGs, PNGs support transparency with varying levels of opacity (alpha channel), and its ability to store a broad range of colors. Its uniqueness lies in its lossless compression.</p>
        <h4>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h4>
        <p>You can use either a web-based resizing tool or software that is already installed on your device.</p>
        <h4>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?</h4>
        <p>Photo editing software is generally preferred over using CSS for several key reasons, primarily related to performance, image quality, and bandwidth efficiency such as when loading a web page.</p>
