        <h1>Links</h1>
        
        <h4>1. Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</h4>
        <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson?lang=eng">President Nelson</a>
        
        <h4>2. What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path? </h4>
        <p>The root folder is the container for your website. In it is where you will find all the html files (and the resources that are linked in them) relative to the root folder so that your browser can find them.</p>
        
        <h4>3. What is a default document?</h4>
        <p>The default document is the home page of your website. You can only have 1 default document and that is an "index.html" file</p>
        
        <h4>4. Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h4>
        <p>An absolute link contains the full URL address of a specific resource, and it follows protocol like "http" or "https". A relative link is a file in relation to the location of the current html file, it only contains the path of a file.</p>
        
        <h4>5. Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).</h4>
        <a href="htmltags.html">HTML tags</a>
        
        <h4>6. List the 3 rules with relative links.</h4>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>same folder rule</li>
            <li>subfolder rule</li>
            <li>parent folder rule</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>7. Link to your last project.</h4>
        <a href="profilepage.html">Brad Pitt</a>
        
        <h4>8. Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h4>
        <p>Links do not always need to be inside a NAV tag. Links can be anywhere on a website page.</p>
