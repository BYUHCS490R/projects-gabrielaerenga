    <h1>Brad Pitt</h1>
    <p>My favourite actor is Brad Pitt. His full name is William Bradley Pitt, and he was born on December 18, 1963 in Oklahoma. He is most known for his roles in the movies "Troy" &amp; "Fight Club" and has a career of acting spanning more than 30 years. </p>
    <p> He has received numerous accolades in his career including academy, golden globes and emmy awards. He has co-founded the production company Plan B Entertainment and has achieved similar success as a producer also. Now in his older years, Brad has been seen taking on more less physically demanding roles as opposed to the action movies he was also known for.</p>
    <p>My favourite movies of his include:</p>
    <ol type="A">
       <li>Fight Club</li>
       <li>Inglorious Basterds</li>
       <li>Bullet Train</li>
       <li>The Ocean's Series</li>
       <li>Fury</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Words to live by:</p>
