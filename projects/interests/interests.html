        <h1>Rugby League</h1>
        <p>One of my favourite interests is the sport called Rugby League. Rugby League is not to be confused with the other sport Rugby Union as there are differences in rules, playstyles and points scored. I guess if I were to explain to an American about this interest of mine, it would be the differences between checkers and chess; being Rugby League and Rugby Union respectively.</p>
        
        <p>Rugby League is very fast paced compared to it's predecessor, filled with full body contact, and tactics on the fly. I could explain all the rules here but that will take too long; so instead I will post an absolute link* right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JPPzTnUZz4">here.</a> This video is narrated by the actor Russell Crowe. Me personally, I would have liked another actor to narrate it. Speaking of which I can post a relative link** to show you who that might be right <a href="../profilepage.html">here.</a></p>
