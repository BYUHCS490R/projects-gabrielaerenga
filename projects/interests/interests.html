        <h1>Rugby League</h1>
        <p>One of my favourite interests is the sport called Rugby League. Rugby League is not to be confused with the other sport <span style="color: darkgray;">Rugby Union</span> as there are differences in rules, playstyles and points scored. I guess if I were to explain to an American about this interest of mine, it would be the differences between checkers and chess; being Rugby League and Rugby Union respectively.</p>
        
        <p>Rugby League is very fast paced compared to it's predecessor, filled with full body contact, and tactics on the fly. I could explain all the rules here but that will take too long; so instead I will post an absolute link* right <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JPPzTnUZz4">here.</a> This video is narrated by the actor Russell Crowe. Me personally, I would have liked another actor to narrate it. Speaking of which I can post a relative link** to show you who that might be right <a class="link" href="../profilepage.html">here.</a></p>

            <li class="q1">This is the color I used to emphasize text. It is black with added font weight and size.</li>

            <li class="q2">This is the color I used to de-emphasize text. It is #D5D3D9.</li>

            <li class="q3">I chose my colors based on an online color pallette generator called coolors.co. I was able to get my base colors from there and edited how I felt what worked well together.</li>
