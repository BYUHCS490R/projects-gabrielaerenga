    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>The Internet is a network of computers that can communicate with each other.</p>
    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>The web is the set of web pages displayed on web browsers.</p>
    <h2>How are the Internet and web different?</h2>
    <p>The internet is just the network itself, the web is just one way of using said network</p>
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>ASCII stands for the American Standard Code for Informtaion Interchange. It represents the standard english letters. 
        Whereas, Unicode represents every other universal character in every writing system in the world as well as symbols and emojis.</p>
    <h2>What is UTF-8?</h2>
    <p>UTF-8 is a character encoding sytem that helps computers both store and transmit Unicode characters</p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p>A URL is the full web address of a resource found on the internet. It tells your web browser where to find something like web pages, images, videos or files.</p>
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p>A domain name is the text-based address of a website on the internet. While URLs are the full web address, the domain name is the "nickname".</p>
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol that tells computers how to communicate when transferring data on the web.</p>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>HTTPS is the same as an HTTP, however it uses SSL/TLS encryption and more secure. For example, when a website requires you to input sensitive information.</p>
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p>An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to every device that is connected to a network like the internet. It works like a digital address telling other devices where to send data.</p>
    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. It's like the phonebook of the internet, it translates domain names into IP addresses so computers can find each other when sending data.</p>
    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>W3C Recommendations is essentially the official standards of the web. It defines how web technologies like HTML and CSS should work to ensure consistency, 
        compatibility and accessibility across different browsers and devices.</p>
    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p>X stands for eXtensible, HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
        XML focuses mainly on data storage and transport.
        XHTML is a hybrid of the eXtensible and HyperText languages and enforces strict XML rules to HTML web pages.
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and defines the structure of said webpage.
        HTML5 is the latest major version of HTML and adds modern features to web pages like multimedia support, graphics and animations and semantic tags to name a few.</p>
