    <title>Final Proposal</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My proposal</h1>
    <h4>1. The title and topic of your site.</h4>
    <p>The title of my website will be "The Student Mechanic". The topic will be a blog about a student fixing and maintaining their car here in Hawaii, and what that journey is about.</p>

    <h4>2. A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h4>
    <p>I chose this topic because I have an interest in fixing and maintaining cars. Before I moved to Hawaii for study, I had acquired a bunch of tools back in Australia and learned enough to be able to service my own car and was on the cusp of doing some beginner friendly modifications on the vehicles at home. And I also thought that it would be good challenge for me since its something I feel is different.</p>

    <h4>3. List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Home: an overview encompassing everything in the website. Like an Intro section, featured post, quick links to different web pages, or a quote.</li>
        <li>Sign Up: a page featuring a form that will prompt visitors to fill out a form to sign up for a mailing list and receive updates on new posts.</li>
        <li>Gallery: a page featuring pictures of cars and or tools</li>
        <li>Contact: a page to contact and including social links</li>
        <li>Hawaii Car Costs: a page featuring a table that shows the costs of different admin fees after purchasing a car etc.</li>
        <li>About: a page featuring an about me section</li>
        <li>Blog Posts: a page featured with cards linking to blogposts written by "me" OR a Tutorial page featuring DIY videos of how tos and pictures of such.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>text: name</li>
        <li>email: email</li>
        <li>select box: oahu, big island, etc for location</li>
        <li>radio: beginner, intermediate, pro diyer skill</li>
        <li>check box: they agree to receive email updates</li>
        <li>text area: what car do they drive?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The data that will go into my table will be a breakdown of the costs associated with owning a car in Hawaii. Such as Fee Name, Amount, Applies to state/county, Notes, and the sources of information using absolute links.</p>

    <h4>5. How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h4>
    <p>I will feature absolute links to accompany new pieces of information as well as links to accompany pictures and videos if they are not my own. For example I could embed a tutorial video featuring a link of where said video is from. I plan on using references from the following so far:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://chris-fix.com/">ChrisFix website</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCes1EvRjcKU4sY_UEavndBw">ChrisFix Youtube Channel</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.tfhawaii.org/wordpress/state-tax-resources/mini-tax-guides/motor-vehicle-weight-tax-chapter-249-county-ordinances/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">TF Hawaii</a></li>
    </ul>
