        <h2>costs</h2>
        <p>To help with those that are from the mainland of the US and/or others from other countries I have included the following table to help visualise the costs of owning a vehicle in the state of Hawaii.</p>

        <p>Please note that this table only reflects the county of O'ahu in the state of Hawai'i. You will need to look up what the county laws are for the place you will be registering a vehicle. Also the total costs will be dependent on how heavy your vehicle is. Mahalo!</p>
